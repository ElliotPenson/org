* Credentials

  For general use, the ~aws configure~ command is the fastest way to set up your
  AWS CLI installation. The AWS CLI will prompt you for four pieces of
  information. AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key are your account
  credentials.

  The AWS CLI supports /named profiles/ stored in the config and credentials
  files. You can configure additional profiles by using ~aws configure~ with the
  ~--profile~ option or by adding entries to the config and credentials
  files. To use a named profile, add the ~--profile~ option to your command.
  
* Commands

  ~aws <service> <command>~. Like ~aws s3 ls~.
