#+TITLE: Amazon EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides
resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to
obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale
capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. EC2 is
effectively virtual machines in the cloud.

Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for
capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers the tools to
build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure
scenarios.

See the [[https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/][EC2 FAQs]] for more information.

* Pricing Options

** On Demand

   Pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.
   
   Use Cases:
   - Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot
     be interrupted.
   - Applications that are being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first
     time.
   - Users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any
     up-front payment or long-term commitment.

** Reserved

   Provides you with a capacity reservation, and offers a significant discount
   on the hourly charge for an instance. 1 year or 3 year terms.

   Use cases:
  - Applications with a steady state or predictable usage.
  - Applications that require reserved capacity.
  - Users are able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing
    costs even further.

** Spot

   Enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing
   for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end
   times. Once the price goes below your bid, your instance will start up.

   Use cases:
   - Applications that have flexible start and end times.
   - Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices. Example
     usage might be big data processing that can happen at 3AM.
   - Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity.

   *Note*: with spot instances, if you terminate the instance, you pay for the
   hour. If AWS terminates the spot instance, you get the hour it was terminated
   in for free.

** Dedicated Hosts

   Physical EC2 server /dedicated/ for your use. This in contrast to the other
   types which are /shared/. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by
   allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses. Can be
   purchased on-demand (hourly). Can also be purchased as a reservation for up
   to 70% off the on-demand price.

   Use cases:
   - Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant
     virtualization.
   - Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud
     deployments.

* Instance Types

  [[file:../images/ec2-instance-types.png]]

  These types can be remembered with...

  - *D*: Density.
  - *R*: RAM.
  - *M*: Main choice for general purpose applications.
  - *C*: Compute.
  - *G*: Graphics.
  - *I*: IOPS.
  - *F*: Field Programmable Gate Array.
  - *T*: "Tiny", cheap general purpose.
  - *P*: Graphics (think Pics)
  - *X*: Extreme memory.

* Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

  When first creating an EC2 instance you get to choose an Amazon Machine Image
  (AMI). An AMI is a virtual appliance. The main component is a read-only
  filesystem image that includes an operating system and any additional
  software.

* Termination

  /Terminating/ an instance shuts it down and deletes it. On an EBS-backed
  instance, the default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted when the
  instance is terminated.

  *Termination Protection* can be set on EC2 instances to prevent termination
  until the option is disabled.

* Encryption

  EBS volumes may be encrypted. However, EBS Root Volumes of your DEFAULT AMIs
  cannot be encrypted. You can also use a third party tool (such as bit locker
  etc) to encrypt the root volume, or this can be done when creating AMIs in the
  AWS console or using the API. Of course, additional volumes can be encrypted.
