  Netscape made the single worst strategic mistake when they decided to rewrite
  the code from scratch in version 5.0. This version was never released!

  Programmers always want to throw away the code and start over. They think the
  old code is a mess because it's harder to read code than to write it. Old code
  has been used and tested. The "little hairs" on code are often bug fixes. When
  you throw away code and start from scratch, you are throwing away all that
  knowledge. All those collected bug fixes.

  Architectural, efficiency, and style problems can all be solved without
  throwing away the code.

  Lastly, there's no reason to believe you'll actually do a better job than the
  first time.
