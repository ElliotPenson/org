  Edsger W. Dijkstra (1930-2002) was a Dutch computer science pioneer. Dijkstra
  made fundamental contributions to a diverse set of areas in the field
  (including compilers, distributed computing, concurrent programming, and
  program design). He also had significant contributions to algorithms
  (e.g. *Dijkstra's algorithm*). Dijkstra's 1968 letter /Go To Statement
  Considered Harmful/ highlighted dangers of the ~goto~ statement. He advocated
  (and coined the term) *structured programming*.

  "Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about
  telescopes."

  "Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability."

  "The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the
  question of whether a submarine can swim."

* Turing, Alan

  Alan Turning (1912-1954) was an English computer scientist. Turing was
  instrumental in the development of computer science theory. He formalized
  computation with the *Turing machine* (part of the *Church-Turing
  thesis*). During WWII, Turing worked at Bletchley Park as a codebreaker. In
  his 1950 paper, /Computing Machinery and Intelligence/, Turing devised the
  *Turing test*.
