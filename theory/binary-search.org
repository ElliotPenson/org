*Binary search* is a fast algorithm for searching in a sorted array. We compare
the key $q$ to the middle item. If $q$ is smaller, it must appear in the first
half; if not it must reside in the second half. By repeating this process
recursively on the correct half, we locate the key in $\lg n$ comparisons.

Binary search is the power behind twenty questions!

* Implementation

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
    def binary_search(item, array, start=None, end=None):
        """Precondition: array is sorted"""
        if start is None or end is None:
            start, end = 0, len(array)

        middle_index = (start + end) // 2
        if start >= end:
            return False
        elif item == array[middle_index]:
            return True
        elif item < array[middle_index]:
            return binary_search(item, array, start, middle_index)
        else:
            return binary_search(item, array, middle_index + 1, end)

** Counting Occurrences

   Suppose we want to count the number of times a given key $k$ occurs in a
   given sorted array. We could use binary search to find the index of an
   element in the correct block in $O(\lg n)$ time. Then we sequentially test
   elements to the left and right until we find one that differs from the
   key. The difference between the boundaries (plus one) gives the count of
   the number of occurrences of $k$. This algorithm runs in $O(\lg n + s)$,
   where $s$ is the number of occurrences of the key.

   A fast algorithm results by modifying binary search to search for the
   /boundary/ of the block containing $k$, instead of $k$ itself. We perform
   this search twice, for a total time of $O(\lg n)$, so we can count the
   occurrences in logarithmic time regardless of the size of the block.

** One-Sided Binary Search

   Suppose we don't know the bounds of our sorted collection. Binary search can
   also proceed from a specific position at repeatedly larger intervals (1, 2,
   4, 8, 16) until we find a value greater than our key. We now have a window
   containing the target and can proceed with binary search. /One-sided binary
   search/ is most useful whenever we are looking for a key that lies close to
   our current position.

** Square and Other Roots

   Suppose we are searching for the square root $r$ of $n$. Notice that the
   square root of $n \leq 1$ must be at least 1 and at most $n$. Consider the
   midpoint $m$ of this interval. How does $m^2$ compare to $n$? If $n \leq
   m^2$, then the square root must be greater than $m$, so the algorithm
   repeats on a new range of values. This application of binary search
   identifies the square root within Â±1 after only $\lg n$ rounds. Root-finding
   algorithms that converge faster are known, but this is simple, robust and
   applies to other functions.
