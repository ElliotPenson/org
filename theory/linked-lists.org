#+TITLE: Linked Lists
#+AUTHOR: Elliot Penson

A *linked list* is a [[file:./data-structures.org][data structure]] that stores items in sequence. Each *node*
contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list. The first node is
the *head* and the last node is the *tail*. The tail's next field is null.

Nodes in *doubly linked lists* also contain a reference to the predecessor.

* Linked Lists vs. Arrays

  A list is similar to an array in that it contains objects in linear order. The
  key differences are that inserting and deleting elements in a list has time
  complexity $O(1)$. On the other hand, obtaining the kth element in a list is
  expensive, having $O(n)$ time complexity.

* Implementation

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, value, next=None):
            self.value = value
            self.next = next
  #+END_SRC

** Search

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
    def search(key, linked_list):
        """Find the Node with value=key. Return None if not found."""
        if linked_list is None or linked_list.value == key:
            return linked_list
        else:
            return search(key, linked_list.next)
  #+END_SRC

** TODO Reverse

** TODO Find Cycle
