* Algorithm Properties

  *In-place* refers to memory usage. An in-place algorithms needs only
  constant ($O(1)$) memory beyond the items being sorted. In-place
  sorting algorithms usually work within and overwrite the input
  array. Note that sometimes $O(\log{}n)$ additional memory is
  considered in-place.

  A *stable* sorting algorithm maintains the relative order of the
  input. For example, suppose one has an array of people. Each person
  has an age and a name. Using a stable sorting algorithm, the array
  is sorted first on age, then on name. When you look at the cluster
  of people named "John," you'll notice that they are still organized
  by age.
