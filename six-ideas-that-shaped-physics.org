** Chapter #1 Introduction to Interactions

   When an isolated set of objects interacts with one another, we find
   that (no matter how the objects interact) certain quantities (which
   we call the set's total *energy*, *momentum*, and *angular
   momentum*) are /conserved/ (i.e., have values that do not change
   with time). The laws of physics are independent of /time/, /place/,
   and /orientation/.

   *Mechanics* is the area of physics that deals with how the physical
   interactions between object affect their motion.

   *Newton's first law*: Any object that does not interact with
   something else moves with a /constant speed/ in a /fixed
   direction/. An *interaction* is a physical relationship /between two
   objects/ that, in the absence of other interactions, /changes/ the
   motion of each. Newton's model sees friction as being an interaction
   between a moving object and something else that actively /slows down
   the object/.

   All matter consists of elementary particles known as *quarks* and
   *leptons*. Electrons are an example of the more general class
   leptons, while protons and neutrons are constructed of quarks.

   There are four fundamental interactions:

   - *string nuclear*
   - *electromagnetic*
   - *weak nuclear*
   - *gravitational*

   Between *macroscopic* objects, we see *long-range* interactions:

   - *electrostatic*
   - *magnetic*
   - *gravitational*

   and *contact interactions*:

   - *friction*
   - *compression*
   - *tension*

   Note that at the fundamental level, electrostatic, magnetic, and all
   contact interactions are different manifestations of the
   electromagnetic interaction.

** Chapter #2 Vectors

   A *scalar* quantity is any quantity (such as speed) that we can
   completely describe using a single numerical value. A *vector* is a
   quantity (such as velocity) that has *direction* in addition to a
   numerical *magnitude*.

   *Displacement* is a shift in position from one point in space to
   another. See pages 27 and 28 for examples of *vector addition*
   ($\vec{u_1}+\vec{u_2}$), *vector inverse* ($\vec{u_1}+\vec{u_2}=0$),
   and *vector difference* ($\vec{u_1}-\vec{u_2}$). Note that
   $\vec{u_1}-\vec{u_2}=\vec{u_1}+(-\vec{u_2})$.

   A vector is a sum of three component vectors:

   \begin{equation}
   \vec{u}=u_x\hat{x}+u_y\hat{y}+u_z\hat{z}
   \end{equation}

   The $\hat{x}$, $\hat{y}$, and $\hat{z}$ are *directionals*. We call
   $u_x$, $u_y$, $u_z$ the *x component*, *y component*, and *z
   component*. A *component vector* is the combination of a component
   and a directional.

   The *magnitude* of an arbitrary vector is as follows:

   \begin{equation}
   mag(\vec{u})=\sqrt{u_x^2+u_y^2+u_z^2}
   \end{equation}

   Pages 32 and 33 relate basic trigonometry to vectors. Note: the
   three angles of a triangle add to 180 degrees.

   As expected, vector addition and difference can be calculated using
   components in vector notation.

   A *reference frame* is an "imaginary cubical grid". We need to
   choose the *origin*, and the *+x*, *+y*, and *+z directions*. Note
   that we can attach a reference frame to any object that we
   please. We can also orient the frame in any way that we like.

   We can calculate the displacement between two points with vector
   difference.

   We can use our right hand to determine axis directions in a
   *right-handed reference frame*. See figure C2.11a on page 38 for an
   example. In *standard orientation*, +x=east, +y=north, +z=up.

** Chapter #3 Interactions Transfer Momentum

   A *particle* is a hypothetical object having zero volume, and thus
   its position is a mathematical point in space. The position
   $\vec{r}$ of a point in space is its displacement from the reference
   frame origin to the point in question. The displacement between two
   arbitrary points is the difference of their positions:
   $\Delta\vec{r}\equiv\vec{r_2}-\vec{r_1}$.

   A particles *velocity* $\vec{v}$ at a given instant of time t is a
   vector whose magnitude is the particle's speed $v$ and whose
   direction is the particle's direction of motion at that instance of
   time. Let $dt$ be the duration of a time interval containing the
   instant $t$ at which we want to know $\vec{v}$, and let $d\vec{r}$
   be the particle's tiny displacement during that tiny time
   interval. If $dt$ is /sufficiently short/ that neither the particle's
   speed nor its direction of motion changes appreciable during that
   time interval, then the particle's velocity is:

   \begin{equation}
   \vec{v}\equiv\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}
   \end{equation}

   *Speed* is the magnitude of a particle's velocity:
   \begin{equation}
   mag(\vec{v})\equiv\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2}
   \end{equation}

   Remember from chapter 1 that an *interaction* between two objects is
   a physical relationship between them that allows each to affect the
   other's motion. *Momentum*, or the "quantity of motion", is defined
   as:

   \begin{equation}
   \vec{p}\equiv m\vec{v}
   \end{equation}

   The *momentum-transfer principle*: any interaction between two
   objects affects their motion by transferring momentum from one to
   the other.

   Physicists call the amount of momentum that a /particular/
   interaction A between two particles transfers to either particle
   during a short interval of time the *impulse* $[d\vec{p}]_A$ that
   the interaction delievers to that particle during that interval. A
   financial analogy may help us understand some subtle distinctions in
   meaning between the terms /a particle's momentum/, /impulse/, and
   /momentum/ in general. Think of the /particle's momentum/ as being
   like a person's net financial worth. An /interaction/ is like a
   financial transaction that increases on person's net worth at the
   expense of the other's. An /impulse/ is like a check that a person
   writes or receives in the transaction. The term /momentum/ is, like
   /money/, a general term for both what each particle (person) has and
   what is being transferred.

   The change $d\vec{p}$ in the momentum of a particle that
   participates in multiple interactions during a given interval is the
   /vector sum/ of the impulses it receives during that interval

   \begin{equation}
   d\vec{p}=[d\vec{p}]_A + [d\vec{p}]_B + ...
   \end{equation}

   We define the *force* $\vec{F}$ that an interaction exerts on a
   given object to be the /rate/ at which momentum flows into the
   object because of that interaction:

   \begin{equation}
   \vec{F}_A \equiv \frac{[d\vec{p}]_A}{dt}
   \end{equation}

   The SI unit of force is the *newton*, where $1 N = 1 kg*m/s^2$.

   We can visualize an interaction between two particles as being like
   a hose that carries a flow of momentum from one to the other. Since
   any momentum that flows /out/ of one must flow /into/ the other, the
   /magnitude/ of the rate of momentum flow must be the same for both
   particles. This statement and the definition of force directly imply
   that: A given interaction between particles A and B must exert a
   force on B that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction the
   the force that it exerts on A: $\vec{F}_{on B} = -\vec{F}_{on
   A}$. Physicists call this statement *Newton's third law*.

   A particle's *mass* simply expresses the relationship between its
   momentum and its velocity, each of which we can define
   separately. /Mass/ and /weight/ are /completely distinct
   concepts/. An object's mass expresses its resistance to changes in
   its velocity. An object's *weight* $\vec{F}_g$, however expresses
   the force that a gravitational interaction exerts on teh object as a
   certain point in space. /Mass/ is a /scalar/ measured in kilograms;
   /weight/ is a /vector/ measured in newtons.

   \begin{equation}
   \vec{F}_g = m\vec{g}
   \end{equation}

   Where $\vec{g}$ is the *gravitational field vector* at a certain
   point in space. Near the earth's surface, $\vec{g}$ points toward
   the earth's center, and the *gravitational field strength* $g \equiv
   mag(\vec{g}) = 9.8 N/kg$.

   There are two momentum flow and motion models discussed in the book:
   the *multitap model* and the *three-reservoir model*. See
   page 56. Also see page 57-58 for some common mistakes made when
   working with vectors.

** Chapter #4 Particles and Systems

   A *system* in physics is a set of interacting particles having a
   well-defined "boundary" that allows us to determine whether a given
   particle is inside or outside the system. An *extended object* is a
   material object with well-defined /surface/ in space that defines
   its boundary and encloses a nonzero volume.

   There are two categories of system interaction. If /both/ particles
   involved in the interaction are inside the system, we call it an
   *internal interaction*; if one of the two particles involved in the
   interaction is inside the system and the other is outside, then we
   call it an *external interaction*.

   We define a system's *total momentum* $\vec{p}_{tot}$ to be the vector
   sum of the momenta of its constituent particles:

   \begin{equation}
   \vec{p}_{tot} \equiv \vec{p}_1 + \vec{p}_2 + ... + \vec{p}_N
   \end{equation}

   The *momentum-transfer principal* (from last chapter) means that a
   system's internal interactions only transfer momentum back and forth
   /within/ the system and therefore cannot affect a system's total
   momentum. /Only external interactions can transfer momentum into or
   out of a system/ and thus change its total momentum. If a system
   participates in /no/ external interactions, we call it an *isolated
   system*. Since no momentum can flow either into or out of such a
   system, the following holds: *The law of conservation of momentum*:
   the total momentum $\vec{p}_{tot}$ of an /isolated/ system is
   /conserved/. That is, it does not change with time.

   The *center of mass* of /any/ system of particles is a mathematical
   point whose position we define as follows:

   \begin{equation}
   \vec{r}_{CM} \equiv \frac{1}{M}(m_1\vec{r}_1 + m_2\vec{r}_2 + ... +
   ... m_N\vec{r}_N)
   \end{equation}

   Where $\vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2, ..., \vec{r}_N$ are the positions of
   the system's N particles. $m_1, m_2, ..., m_N$ are their masses; and
   $M \equiv m_1 + ... + m_N$ is the system's mass.

   In many systems, there's an outrageously huge number of elementary
   particles involved. A practical (but approximate) method is to break
   the object up into a moderate number of macroscopic chunks that are
   still small enough that we can consider the particles in each to
   have essentially the same position.

   Note that we can calculate the position of the center of mass of any
   /set/ of extended objects by treating each object as if it were a
   point particle with all its mass concentrated at its /individual/
   center of mass.

   To find a systems total momentum, all that we need to do is to
   multiply its total mass M by the velocity of its center of mass
   $\vec{v}_{CM}$, /exactly as if the system were a single particle
   located at its center of mass!/

   \begin{equation}
   \vec{p}_{tot} = M\vec{v}_{CM}
   \end{equation}

   In conjunction with the law of conservation of momentum, the
   equation above implies that an /isolated/ system's $\vec{v}_{CM}$ is
   a constant. This is simply /Newton's first law/, except we now see
   that it applies to arbitrary systems, not just to particles!

   *The particle model*: A system's center of mass responds to its
   /external/ interactions /exactly/ as a point particle would respond
   to those interactions. This means that every idea of equation that
   we have formulated up to now for interacting /particles/ also
   applies to any /system/ of particles, as long as we substitute the
   system quantities $\vec{r}_{CM}$, $\vec{v}_{CM}$, and
   $\vec{p}_{tot}$ for the particle quantities $\vec{r}$, $\vec{v}$,
   and $\vec{p}$, respectively, and put the qualifier /external/ in
   front of any references to /interactions/.

   *Inertial reference frames* are reference frames in which we find
   Newton's first law to be obeyed; *noninertial reference frames* are
   frames in which we find it to be violated. The models of motion we
   have been developing work in inertial reference frames but fail in
   noninertial reference frames.

** Chapter #5 Applying Momentum Conservation

   A system does not have to be strictly isolated for its total
   momentum to be conserved. For example, the gravitation and
   compression interations a laptop experiences when it's sitting on a
   desk are negligible because they cancel each other out. In general,
   a system's momentum is conserved in any process where its external
   interactions do not change its total momentum /significantly/ during
   that process. There are three distinct types of situations in which
   this is true:

   - *Floats in space*: only interacts gravitationally with distant
     objects
   - *Functionally isolated*: external interactions cancel
   - *Momentarily isolated*: strong external interactions that do /not/
     cancel, but we only look at the system's momentum /just before/
     and /just after/ a very strong and brief interaction. If the
     collision process is sufficiently brief, external interactions
     simply do not have /time/ to transfer significant momentum to the
     system.

*** Problem-Solving Framework

    - Translation -> draw a picture
    - Conceptual model -> applicable theories/principles
    - Algebraic solution -> solve equations symbolically
    - Evaluation -> check results make sense

    Draw an *interaction diagram* as follows: draw a large circle to
    represent the system, and draw one rectangular box inside that
    circle for each object inside the system, labeling the box with the
    object's name. If the object inside the system interact with object
    outside the system, draw a box outside the circle for each relevant
    object outside the system, and label these boxes as well. Then draw
    lines connecting the boxes to represent the internal and external
    interactions involved.
