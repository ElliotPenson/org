#+TITLE: Containers
#+AUTHOR: Elliot Penson

A *container* is a lightweight linux environment that lets one package
application pieces into a hermetic, deployable unit. Containers raise the
abstraction layer from idealized hardware (virtual machines) to idealized
operating systems. Developers care about containers because...

- the static application environment makes deployments more *reliable*.
- the repeatable, runnable artifact makes code *portable*.
- applications are *loosely coupled* and can be organized as microservices.
- the consistent framework is particularly *automatable*.
