* Chapter #1 Introduction to Interactions

  When an isolated set of objects interacts with one another, we find
  that (no matter how the objects interact) certain quantities (which
  we call the set's total *energy*, *momentum*, and *angular
  momentum*) are /conserved/ (i.e., have values that do not change
  with time). The laws of physics are independent of /time/, /place/,
  and /orientation/.

  *Mechanics* is the area of physics that deals with how the physical
  interactions between object affect their motion.

  *Newton's first law*: Any object that does not interact with
  something else moves with a /constant speed/ in a /fixed
  direction/. An *interaction* is a physical relationship /between two
  objects/ that, in the absence of other interactions, /changes/ the
  motion of each. Newton's model sees friction as being an interaction
  between a moving object and something else that actively /slows down
  the object/.

  All matter consists of elementary particles known as *quarks* and
  *leptons*. Electrons are an example of the more general class
  leptons, while protons and neutrons are constructed of quarks.

  There are four fundamental interactions:

  - *string nuclear*
  - *electromagnetic*
  - *weak nuclear*
  - *gravitational*

  Between *macroscopic* objects, we see *long-range* interactions:

  - *electrostatic*
  - *magnetic*
  - *gravitational*

  and *contact interactions*:

  - *friction*
  - *compression*
  - *tension*

  Note that at the fundamental level, electrostatic, magnetic, and all
  contact interactions are different manifestations of the
  electromagnetic interaction.

* Chapter #2 Vectors

  A *scalar* quantity is any quantity (such as speed) that we can
  completely describe using a single numerical value. A *vector* is a
  quantity (such as velocity) that has *direction* in addition to a
  numerical *magnitude*.

  *Displacement* is a shift in position from one point in space to
  another. See pages 27 and 28 for examples of *vector addition*
  ($\vec{u_1}+\vec{u_2}$), *vector inverse* ($\vec{u_1}+\vec{u_2}=0$),
  and *vector difference* ($\vec{u_1}-\vec{u_2}$). Note that
  $\vec{u_1}-\vec{u_2}=\vec{u_1}+(-\vec{u_2})$.

  A vector is a sum of three component vectors:

  \begin{equation}
  \vec{u}=u_x\hat{x}+u_y\hat{y}+u_z\hat{z}
  \end{equation}

  The $\hat{x}$, $\hat{y}$, and $\hat{z}$ are *directionals*. We call
  $u_x$, $u_y$, $u_z$ the *x component*, *y component*, and *z
  component*. A *component vector* is the combination of a component
  and a directional.

  The *magnitude* of an arbitrary vector is as follows:

  \begin{equation}
  mag(\vec{u})=\sqrt{u_x^2+u_y^2+u_z^2}
  \end{equation}

  Pages 32 and 33 relate basic trigonometry to vectors. Note: the
  three angles of a triangle add to 180 degrees.

  As expected, vector addition and difference can be calculated using
  components in vector notation.

  A *reference frame* is an "imaginary cubical grid". We need to
  choose the *origin*, and the *+x*, *+y*, and *+z directions*. Note
  that we can attach a reference frame to any object that we
  please. We can also orient the frame in any way that we like.

  We can calculate the displacement between two points with vector
  difference.

  We can use our right hand to determine axis directions in a
  *right-handed reference frame*. See figure C2.11a on page 38 for an
  example. In *standard orientation*, +x=east, +y=north, +z=up.

* Chapter #3 Interactions Transfer Momentum

  A *particle* is a hypothetical object having zero volume, and thus
  its position is a mathematical point in space. The position
  $\vec{r}$ of a point in space is its displacement from the reference
  frame origin to the point in question. The displacement between two
  arbitrary points is the difference of their positions:
  $\Delta\vec{r}\equiv\vec{r_2}-\vec{r_1}$.

  A particles *velocity* $\vec{v}$ at a given instant of time t is a
  vector whose magnitude is the particle's speed $v$ and whose
  direction is the particle's direction of motion at that instance of
  time. Let $dt$ be the duration of a time interval containing the
  instant $t$ at which we want to know $\vec{v}$, and let $d\vec{r}$
  be the particle's tiny displacement during that tiny time
  interval. If $dt$ is /sufficiently short/ that neither the particle's
  speed nor its direction of motion changes appreciable during that
  time interval, then the particle's velocity is:

  \begin{equation}
  \vec{v}\equiv\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}
  \end{equation}

  *Speed* is the magnitude of a particle's velocity:
  \begin{equation}
  mag(\vec{v})\equiv\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2}
  \end{equation}

  Remember from chapter 1 that an *interaction* between two objects is
  a physical relationship between them that allows each to affect the
  other's motion. *Momentum*, or the "quantity of motion", is defined
  as:

  \begin{equation}
  \vec{p}\equiv m\vec{v}
  \end{equation}

  The *momentum-transfer principle*: any interaction between two
  objects affects their motion by transferring momentum from one to
  the other.

  Physicists call the amount of momentum that a /particular/
  interaction A between two particles transfers to either particle
  during a short interval of time the *impulse* $[d\vec{p}]_A$ that
  the interaction delievers to that particle during that interval. A
  financial analogy may help us understand some subtle distinctions in
  meaning between the terms /a particle's momentum/, /impulse/, and
  /momentum/ in general. Think of the /particle's momentum/ as being
  like a person's net financial worth. An /interaction/ is like a
  financial transaction that increases on person's net worth at the
  expense of the other's. An /impulse/ is like a check that a person
  writes or receives in the transaction. The term /momentum/ is, like
  /money/, a general term for both what each particle (person) has and
  what is being transferred.

  The change $d\vec{p}$ in the momentum of a particle that
  participates in multiple interactions during a given interval is the
  /vector sum/ of the impulses it receives during that interval

  \begin{equation}
  d\vec{p}=[d\vec{p}]_A + [d\vec{p}]_B + ...
  \end{equation}

  We define the *force* $\vec{F}$ that an interaction exerts on a
  given object to be the /rate/ at which momentum flows into the
  object because of that interaction:

  \begin{equation}
  \vec{F}_A \equiv \frac{[d\vec{p}]_A}{dt}
  \end{equation}

  The SI unit of force is the *newton*, where $1 N = 1 kg*m/s^2$.

  We can visualize an interaction between two particles as being like
  a hose that carries a flow of momentum from one to the other. Since
  any momentum that flows /out/ of one must flow /into/ the other, the
  /magnitude/ of the rate of momentum flow must be the same for both
  particles. This statement and the definition of force directly imply
  that: A given interaction between particles A and B must exert a
  force on B that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction the
  the force that it exerts on A: $\vec{F}_{on B} = -\vec{F}_{on
  A}$. Physicists call this statement *Newton's third law*.

  A particle's *mass* simply expresses the relationship between its
  momentum and its velocity, each of which we can define
  separately. /Mass/ and /weight/ are /completely distinct
  concepts/. An object's mass expresses its resistance to changes in
  its velocity. An object's *weight* $\vec{F}_g$, however expresses
  the force that a gravitational interaction exerts on teh object as a
  certain point in space. /Mass/ is a /scalar/ measured in kilograms;
  /weight/ is a /vector/ measured in newtons.

  \begin{equation}
  \vec{F}_g = m\vec{g}
  \end{equation}

  Where $\vec{g}$ is the *gravitational field vector* at a certain
  point in space. Near the earth's surface, $\vec{g}$ points toward
  the earth's center, and the *gravitational field strength* $g \equiv
  mag(\vec{g}) = 9.8 N/kg$.

  There are two momentum flow and motion models discussed in the book:
  the *multitap model* and the *three-reservoir model*. See
  page 56. Also see page 57-58 for some common mistakes made when
  working with vectors.
