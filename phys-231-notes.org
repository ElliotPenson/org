* Chapter #1 Introduction to Interactions

  When an isolated set of objects interacts with one another, we find
  that (no matter how the objects interact) certain quantities (which
  we call the set's total *energy*, *momentum*, and *angular
  momentum*) are /conserved/ (i.e., have values that do not change
  with time). The laws of physics are independent of /time/, /place/,
  and /orientation/.

  *Mechanics* is the area of physics that deals with how the physical
  interactions between object affect their motion.

  *Newton's first law*: Any object that does not interact with
  something else moves with a /constant speed/ in a /fixed
  direction/. An *interaction* is a physical relationship /between two
  objects/ that, in the absence of other interactions, /changes/ the
  motion of each. Newton's model sees friction as being an interaction
  between a moving object and something else that actively /slows down
  the object/.

  All matter consists of elementary particles known as *quarks* and
  *leptons*. Electrons are an example of the more general class
  leptons, while protons and neutrons are constructed of quarks.

  There are four fundamental interactions:

  - *string nuclear*
  - *electromagnetic*
  - *weak nuclear*
  - *gravitational*

  Between *macroscopic* objects, we see *long-range* interactions:

  - *electrostatic*
  - *magnetic*
  - *gravitational*

  and *contact interactions*:

  - *friction*
  - *compression*
  - *tension*

  Note that at the fundamental level, electrostatic, magnetic, and all
  contact interactions are different manifestations of the
  electromagnetic interaction.

* Chapter #2 Vectors

  A *scalar* quantity is any quantity (such as speed) that we can
  completely describe using a single numerical value. A *vector* is a
  quantity (such as velocity) that has *direction* in addition to a
  numerical *magnitude*.

  *Displacement* is a shift in position from one point in space to
  another. See pages 27 and 28 for examples of *vector addition*
  ($\vec{u_1}+\vec{u_2}$), *vector inverse* ($\vec{u_1}+\vec{u_2}=0$),
  and *vector difference* ($\vec{u_1}-\vec{u_2}$). Note that
  $\vec{u_1}-\vec{u_2}=\vec{u_1}+(-\vec{u_2})$.

  A vector is a sum of three component vectors:

  $\vec{u}=u_x\hat{x}+u_y\hat{y}+u_z\hat{z}$

  The $\hat{x}$, $\hat{y}$, and $\hat{z}$ are *directionals*. We call
  $u_x$, $u_y$, $u_z$ the *x component*, *y component*, and *z
  component*. A *component vector* is the combination of a component
  and a directional.

  The *magnitude* of an arbitrary vector is as follows:

  $mag(\vec{u})=\sqrt{u_x^2+u_y^2+u_z^2}$

  Pages 32 and 33 relate basic trigonometry to vectors. Note: the
  three angles of a triangle add to 180 degrees.

  As expected, vector addition and difference can be calculated using
  components in vector notation.

  A *reference frame* is an "imaginary cubical grid". We need to
  choose the *origin*, and the *+x*, *+y*, and *+z directions*. Note
  that we can attach a reference frame to any object that we
  please. We can also orient the frame in any way that we like.

  We can calculate the displacement between two points with vector
  difference.

  We can use our right hand to determine axis directions in a
  *right-handed reference frame*. See figure C2.11a on page 38 for an
  example. In *standard orientation*, +x=east, +y=north, +z=up.
