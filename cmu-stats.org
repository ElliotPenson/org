* Introduction
  
** Metacognition
   
   Metacognition, or "thinking about thinking," refers to your awareness
   of yourself as a learner and your ability to regulate your own
   learning.
   
   1. Assess the task
   2. Evaluate your strengths and weaknesses
   3. Plan an approach
   4. Apply strategies and monitor your performance
   5. Reflect and adjust if needed
   
** The Big Picture
   
   The *population* is the entire group that is the target of our
   interest. *Producing data* involves choosing a sample of the
   population and collecting data from it. Usually we choose a sample
   because the population is too large to examine as a
   whole. *Exploratory Data Analysis* consists of summarizing the
   collected data. *Probability* tells us how the sample we're using may
   differ from the population as a whole. Probability is the "machinery"
   that allows us to draw conslusions about the population based on the
   data collected about the sample. Finally, we can use what we've
   discovered about our sample to draw conslusions about the population
   based on the data collected about the sample. Finally, we can use what
   we've discovered about our sample to draw conslusions about our
   population. We call this final step in the process *inference*.

* Unit 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis
  
** Introduction
   
   *Data* are pieces of information about individuals organized into
   variables. By an *individual*, we mean a particular person or
   object. By a *variable*, we mean a particular characteristic of the
   individual.
   
   A *dataset* is a set of data identified with particular
   circumstances. Datasets are typically displayed in tables, in which
   rows represent individuals and columns represent variables.
   
   *Quantitative variables* take numerical values, and represent some
   kind of measurement. *Categorical variables* take category or
   label values, and place an individual into one of several groups.
   
   *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* is how we make sense of the data
   by converting them from their raw form to a more informative
   one. EDA consists of:
   - Organizing and summarizing the raw data,
   - Discovering important features and patterns in the data and any
     striking deviations from those patterns, and then,
   - Interpreting our findings in the context of the problem
     
   *Distributions* are concerned with one variable at
   time. *Replationships* are concerned with two variables at a time.
   
** Module 1
   
*** Examining Distributions
    
   By *distribution* of a variable, we mean:
   - What values the variable takes, and
   - How often the variable takes those values.

*** One Categorical Variable

   The distribution of a categorical variable is summarized using:
   - Graphical display: pie chart or bar chart, supplemented by
   - Numerical summaries: category counts and percentages.
      
   The pie chart emphasizes how the different categories relate to the
   whole, and the bar chart ephasizes how the different categories
   compare with each other.

*** One Quantitatice Variable

   To display data from one quantitative variable graphically, we can
   use either the *histogram* or the *stemplot*.

   Breaking a range of values into intervals can be useful for
   graphing. The square brakcet means "including" and the parenthesis
   means "not including". For example, [50,60) is the interval from 50
   to 60, including 50 and not including 60.

   Once the distribution has been displayed graphically, we can
   describe the overall pattern of the distibution and mention any
   striking deviations from that pattern. More specifically, we should
   consider the following features of the distribution:
   - Overall pattern:
     - Shape
     - Center
     - Spread
   - Deviations from the pattern:
     - Outliers

**** Shape

   When describing the shape of a distribution, we should consider:
   1. Symmetry/skewness of the distribution
   2. Peakedness (modality) - the number of peaks (modes) the
      distribution has.

   [[file:images/histogram-shapes.gif][histogram-shapes]]

   From left to right: symmetric, single-peaked (unimodal); symmetric,
   double-peaked (bimodal); symmetric, uniform; skewed-right,
   skewed-left.

   Note that if a distribution has more than two modes, we say that
   the distribution is multimoda.
